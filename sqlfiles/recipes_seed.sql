Melt butter in a large skillet or on a griddle. Place bread slices in skillet or on griddle and cook on medium heat until golden brown on each side, about 2-3 minutes.
Serve immediately or keep warm in oven until ready to serve, but no longer than about 30 minutes.

You are simply dipping your bread slices into the egg mixture. If you leave your bread in the mixture for an extended amount of time, it will absorb more liquid and take longer to cook through.',

Place semisweet, milk and white chocolates in three separate small bowls.
In a small bowl, place cold water and sprinkle the gelatin. Let it stand for about 10 minutes, until the gelatin is soft.
In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with a whisk until the mixture is light yellow and creamy. Place the milk in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Ladle out about 1/2 of the warm milk and add it in a steady stream to the egg yolks, whisking continuously. Pour the warmed egg yolk mixture into the saucepan with the remaining milk and whisk well. Stir over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon. If you run a finger through the coated spoon, it should leave a line down the middle.
Remove the custard from the heat and stir in the softened gelatin until it dissolves. Divide the custard amongst the three bowls of chocolate, pouring about 1/3 cup in each. Stir each chocolate well. If the chocolate does not melt, place on a double boiler/pan of simmering water and stir until melted. Allow the three chocolates to cool to room temperature.
Divide the whipped cream and fold in about 3/4 cup into each bowl of chocolate. There will be some whipped cream left over, set that aside momentarily.
Pour the first layer of chocolate mousse in the serving cups, spreading the top evenly. Freeze for 15 minutes. Continue this process with the remaining chocolate mousses. The mousse can be prepared up to two days in advance; cover each cup with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Sweeten the remaining whipped cream with a about a tablespoon of confectioners sugar, whisk well. Before serving, place a dollop of cream and sprinkle with chocolate covered cocoa nibs.',
