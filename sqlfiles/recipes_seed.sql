Melt butter in a large skillet or on a griddle. Place bread slices in skillet or on griddle and cook on medium heat until golden brown on each side, about 2-3 minutes.
Serve immediately or keep warm in oven until ready to serve, but no longer than about 30 minutes.

Notes:
You are simply dipping your bread slices into the egg mixture. If you leave your bread in the mixture for an extended amount of time, it will absorb more liquid and take longer to cook through.',

Sprinkle with salt.
With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.
Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.
They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.

They are great plain, but can be served with a light vinaigrette if you need something acidic to balance out your meal.',
